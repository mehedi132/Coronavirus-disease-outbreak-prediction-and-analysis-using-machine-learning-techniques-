This research work reveals the ability of machine learning models to estimate the amount of future COVID-19 confirm and death cases, which is currently viewed as a significant threat to mankind.
Four machine learning models have been tasted on eight different countries total affected and death covid-19 cases.
ARIMA, FB Prophet, Xgboost, Holt-winter machine learning models have implemented  in this research.
